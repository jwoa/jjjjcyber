Food deserts are aweful and the people stuck in them often have no idea that they live in one. I decided to build an application that will let users know if they live in one and how they can contact someone for help or make healty eating plans.

## Backstory

I first developed this project years ago but as technilogy and people behaiors have shifted I figured we should update it. I have had this idea for a long time and it stemmed from when I lived in the Bronx and then in Albany.

There wasn't much healthy food around me and the food that was good around me was in areas that wasn't close by. Areas that favored the wealthy and this caused food deserts to appear. 

I wanted to build an application to show if a user is in a food desert and if they are, what they can do about it and how they can potentially make changes.
