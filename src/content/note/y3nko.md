I love my motherland of Ghana. In recent years, a lot of people have come to love it as well.
It's become a popular spot for people to travel to, especially black people lol. 

As someone from here and who has family here its easier for me to navigate and go around than most people,
note that I said easier not easy. There are still some things that make it difficult for foreigners to
get used to when traveling the country like where to go, how to pay for things, how to get a driver. 

So, I decided to build Y3NKO. This website will serve as a singular location for people to book tickets for
events, restaurants, and places to stay.
