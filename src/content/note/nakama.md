I needed a way to manage memberships that belong to a group and particularly how to update the endpoint and uniqe profiles of those individuals once the cards were created. So I made one.

## Backstory

I have always had a love for unique experiences and activations. Things like secret cards and locations.

I wanted a dashboard and tool that I could easily use to manage NFC cards and their endpoints/redirections
as well as the ability to manage users who are subscribed to a service. So I built one.
